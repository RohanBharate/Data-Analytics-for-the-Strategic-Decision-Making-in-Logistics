## 🎯 Project Objectives

The analysis focused on the following key areas to improve logistics operations and reduce inefficiencies:

- 📦 Inventory Optimization  
- ⏱️ Lead Time Analysis  
- 🤝 Supplier Performance Evaluation  
- 🌍 Carbon Emissions Analysis  
- 🛠️ Defect Rate & Waste Analysis

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights

### ✅ Inventory Optimization
- Calculated **Stock Turnover Ratio** for each product type using Excel formulas.
- Used conditional formatting to highlight critical low-stock items.
- **Insight**: Skincare products had the highest turnover (10.85), haircare had the lowest (8.38).

### ⏱️ Lead Time Analysis
- Analyzed average lead times by product and supplier.
- **Insight**: Supplier 3 showed the highest average lead time (20.13 days), while cosmetics had the shortest overall.

### 🤝 Supplier Performance
- Compared **defect rates and lead times** across 5 suppliers.
- **Insight**: Supplier 1 performed best with lowest lead time and defect rate; Supplier 5 had the highest defect rate.

### 🌍 Carbon Emissions Analysis
- Estimated CO₂ emissions based on shipment volume and transport mode.
- **Insight**: Sea transport had the lowest emissions (9.9M), while rail had the highest.

### 🛠️ Defect Rate & Waste Analysis
- Evaluated defect rates by product type and supplier.
- **Insight**: Haircare products had the highest defect rate (2.69%).
